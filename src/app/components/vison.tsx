          <p className='text-sm  md:text-base font-sans'>Pedestal Education is an educational venture to tap into the human potential of young people of Sikkim 
          and to inculcate a competitive spirit among students and aspirants.
          Civil services and government service has always captured the 
          interest of the youth. In Sikkim, UPSC civil service exam has garnered a sense of mysticism 
          with very few of Sikkimese clearing such exams and even fewer represented in governance.
          We hope to provide quality and inclusive guidance and mentorship 
          to overcome any obstacle and illuminate a pathway to not only civil service exams but various other government exams. 
          We at Pedestal pride ourselves in our student centric approach and have assembled a well rounded team to help aspirants in any way they require.
